# Jarvis Voice Assistant

This project is a basic **Voice Assistant** built in Python that can recognize voice commands, respond with synthesized speech, and execute various tasks like web browsing, sending emails, and fetching information from Wikipedia. It uses libraries like `pyttsx3`, `speech_recognition`, `wikipedia`, and others.

## Features

- **Voice Input & Output**: Recognizes voice commands using Google's Speech Recognition API and responds using text-to-speech.
- **Wikipedia Search**: Retrieves brief summaries from Wikipedia.
- **Open Websites**: Commands to open websites like YouTube, Google, and StackOverflow.
- **Play Music**: Plays music from a specific folder on your computer.
- **Tell Time**: Provides the current time.
- **Open Applications**: Launches applications like VS Code.
- **Send Emails**: Can send emails to specific recipients.

## Requirements

Install the required libraries before running the project:

```bash
pip install pyttsx3
pip install speechRecognition
pip install wikipedia
```

Make sure to have **Python 3.x** installed.

## Setup

1. **Text-to-Speech Engine**: The program uses `pyttsx3` with the `sapi5` voice engine. You can modify the voice by changing the index in the line:
   ```python
   engine.setProperty('voice', voices[0].id)  # You can change 'voices[0]' to 'voices[1]' for a different voice
   ```

2. **Speech Recognition**: Google's Speech Recognition API is used to recognize the spoken commands. Ensure you have an active internet connection for this feature.

3. **Email Functionality**: To send an email, you need to update the following line with your Gmail credentials:
   ```python
   server.login('youremail@gmail.com', 'your-password')
   ```
   - It is recommended to use environment variables or a secure way of handling credentials instead of hardcoding them.

4. **Music Directory**: Update the music directory path in this section:
   ```python
   music_dir = 'D:\\Non Critical\\songs\\Favorite Songs2'
   ```

5. **VS Code Path**: Update the path to the application (VS Code or any other program) you want to launch with the command:
   ```python
   codePath = "C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\\Code.exe"
   ```

## Usage

Run the script using Python:

```bash
python jarvis.py
```

Upon running, the assistant will greet you based on the time of day and listen for voice commands. Here are some examples of commands you can use:

- **"Open YouTube"**: Opens the YouTube website.
- **"Search Wikipedia for Python programming"**: Searches for and reads a summary about Python programming from Wikipedia.
- **"Play music"**: Plays the first song in the specified music directory.
- **"What is the time?"**: Reads out the current time.
- **"Email to [name]"**: Sends an email (requires Gmail configuration).

## Error Handling

- The assistant will notify you if it cannot understand the command or if there is an error (e.g., if a Wikipedia page isn't found or a directory is missing).
- The program is set to handle unknown errors and network errors when using Google’s speech recognition service.
